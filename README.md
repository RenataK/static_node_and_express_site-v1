# static_node_and_express_site-v1


This project contains a portfolio site that showcases the projects I've built. 
The site will contains a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to access my contact info, and get to know more about me and a series of project pages I've created. 

The JSON file stores all the data about the projects.

Used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

Used Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
